Notes:
- To create shortcts for the different desktops you have to create them in the workspace menu (3-finger swipe upwards), then in System Controls -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Mission Control -> Switch to Desktop [num]
- Could not fully disable animations everywhere, but System Controls -> Accessibility -> Display -> Reduce Motion helps
- Border Color is buggy and does not work properly
- Adding desktop names in an issue, but it is something I could live without.

Tasks:
- Find a way to disable animations fully
- Setup proper borders for focused windows
- Add desktop names
